## Building

Before building create a directory `lib` and install LibStatGen there. If you have installed LibStatGen somewhere else on your machine you can also change the `STATGENDIR` in the `src/Makefile`.

To build simply do 

	$ make

If the appropiate tools are installed, tests are available via

	$ make test
